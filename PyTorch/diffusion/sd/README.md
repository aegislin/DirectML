## About the Models

Stable Diffusion Turbo & XL Turbo are distilled versions of SD 2.1 and SDXL 1.0 respectively. Both models are fast generative text-to-image model that can synthesize photorealistic images from a text prompt in a single network evaluation.

Refer to the HuggingFace repositories for [SDXL Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo) and [SD Turbo](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-turbo) for more information.


## Setup
Once you've set up `torch-directml` following our [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/pytorch-windows) and [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/directml/pytorch-wsl) guidance, install the requirements by running:


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Run the App
To use Stable Diffusion with the text-to-image interface, run:
```bash
> python app.py
```

When you run this code, a local URL will be displayed on the console. Open http://localhost:7860 (or the local URL you see) in a browser to interact with the text-to-image interface.

Within the interface, use the dropdown to switch between SD Turbo and SDXL Turbo. You can also use the slider to set the number of iteration steps (1 to 4) for image generation.

Enter the desired prompt and "Run" to generate an image:
``` 
Sample Prompt: A professional photo of a cat eating cake
```

Two sample images will be generated:
